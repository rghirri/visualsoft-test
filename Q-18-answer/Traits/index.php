/**
 * WHAT ARE TRAITS?
 * Traits solve code duplication and single inheritance problem.
*  If you can copy and paste the code from one class to another 
* (and weâ€™ve all done this, even though we try not to because its 
*  code duplication), then you have a candidate for a  trait.

* Traits are not interfaces at all. Traits can define both static members 
*  and static methods. It helps developers to reuse methods freely in several 
*  independent classes in different class hierarchies. Traits reduces the complexity, 
*  and avoids problems associated with multiple inheritance and Mixins. Note that PHP 
*  does not allow multiple inheritance. 
*  So Traits is used to fulfill this gap by allowing 
*  us to reuse same functionality in multiple classes.
*
*  Write the same code again, to avoid this use the traits. 
*  The traits are used when multiple classes share the same functionality.
*
*  Traits reduce code duplication
